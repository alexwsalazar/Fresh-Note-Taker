# Fresh Note Taker

## My Task

In this assignment I modified stater code to create a application called Fresh Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses Express.js back end and saves and retrives note data from a JSON file.

The application's front end was already provided for me. it was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the enire application to Heroku.
